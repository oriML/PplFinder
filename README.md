Hi! Tnx for the extremely cool assignment! :)

plz let me mention 2 problems that I have notice:
at file UserList.js -> Checkbox component, the nat="DE" attached to the label="Germany".
It seems to have an inattention at this part. it's the API's creators responsability but important
to mention it.

at Text.js -> the console returnes a validateDomNesting error.
the problem was at Text.js. the Typography component is set to be a <p> by
default and its children to <div>.
my solution:
I set the variant property at Typography component to 'h3' 
and at style.js of Text.js I set the line-height to 150% to keep on the same style look.

2 Tasks are completed.
Bonus expanded -> countries Checkboxes rendered by the countries of the fetched users.
Favorites page -> embedded search bar. favorites rendered by search input of name, email or country.

Tnx again! :-)
